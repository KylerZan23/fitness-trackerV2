# Prompt 1 & 2 Implementation: Minimal Signup & Authenticated Onboarding Flow

## Overview
Implemented a complete two-phase signup and onboarding system:
1. **Prompt 1**: Minimal signup that collects only essential information (email, password, name) and immediately redirects to onboarding
2. **Prompt 2**: Adapted onboarding page to work with authenticated user context and finalize profile setup with AI program generation

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates (`src/lib/schemas.ts`)
- **Added** `minimalSignupSchema` for the simplified signup flow
- **Added** `MinimalSignupFormData` TypeScript type
- **Kept** original `signupSchema` for backward compatibility

### 2. Signup Page Refactor (`src/app/signup/page.tsx`) - Prompt 1
- **Removed** `age` and `fitnessGoals` fields from the signup form
- **Switched** to `minimalSignupSchema` for form validation
- **Added** immediate profile creation after successful signup to prevent timing issues
- **Updated** `onSubmit` handler to redirect to `/onboarding` instead of showing email confirmation
- **Removed** success view component and email confirmation flow
- **Added** encouraging messaging about personalization in next step
- **Simplified** user metadata to only include `name`

### 3. Onboarding Page Updates (`src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`) - Prompt 2
- **Streamlined** authentication check to expect authenticated users
- **Updated** redirect logic: unauthenticated users go to `/signup` instead of `/login`
- **Enhanced** profile validation and error handling
- **Updated** to use new `finalizeOnboardingAndGenerateProgram` server action
- **Improved** program status checking for completed onboarding scenarios
- **Added** better logging for debugging authentication flow

### 4. Server Action Updates (`src/app/_actions/onboardingActions.ts`) - Prompt 2
- **Added** `finalizeOnboardingAndGenerateProgram` function as main entry point
- **Added** `FullOnboardingAnswers` type alias for clarity
- **Maintained** backward compatibility with existing `saveOnboardingData` function
- **Enhanced** documentation and deprecation notices

### 5. Auth Confirmation Simplification (`src/app/auth/confirm/page.tsx`) - Prompt 2
- **Simplified** to focus only on email confirmation status
- **Removed** profile creation logic (now handled in signup)
- **Added** intelligent redirect based on onboarding completion status
- **Enhanced** error handling to be non-blocking

### 6. Key Flow Changes

#### Before (Original):
```
Signup (comprehensive) → Email Confirmation → Dashboard (optional onboarding)
```

#### After Prompt 1:
```
Signup (minimal) + Profile Creation → Redirect to Onboarding → Email Confirmation → Dashboard
```

#### After Prompt 2 (Final):
```
Signup (minimal) + Profile Creation → Authenticated Onboarding → Profile Finalization + AI Program → Email Confirmation (optional) → Dashboard
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
- **Signup**: Creates basic profile immediately with `onboarding_completed: false`
- **Onboarding**: Expects authenticated user, validates profile exists
- **Server Action**: Updates existing profile with comprehensive onboarding data
- **Email Confirmation**: Simple status update and intelligent redirect

### Profile Creation Timing
**Issue Resolved**: Users were redirected to onboarding before profile creation.

**Solution**: 
1. Create basic profile immediately during signup
2. Onboarding validates profile exists and redirects to signup if missing
3. Server action updates existing profile instead of creating new one

### Server Action Architecture
```typescript
// New primary function for simplified flow
export async function finalizeOnboardingAndGenerateProgram(formData: FullOnboardingAnswers): Promise<ActionResponse>

// Backward compatible function
export async function saveOnboardingData(formData: OnboardingAndProfileData): Promise<ActionResponse>
```

### Error Handling & User Experience
- **Profile Missing**: Redirect to signup to recreate profile
- **Authentication Missing**: Redirect to signup for new users
- **Onboarding Complete**: Check for active program before allowing redo
- **Email Confirmation**: Non-blocking updates with graceful fallbacks

## Bug Fixes

### Console Error Resolution (Prompt 1)
**Problem**: `Error loading profile: {}` when users reached onboarding page after signup.
**Solution**: Create basic profile immediately during signup.

### Authentication Context (Prompt 2)
**Problem**: Onboarding page needed to handle authenticated user context properly.
**Solution**: Streamlined auth checks and improved profile validation.
