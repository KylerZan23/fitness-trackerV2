## Authentication

The app uses Supabase Authentication with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) support:

1. Middleware-based session verification for protected routes
2. Cookie-based authentication using the `@supabase/ssr` package
3. Separation of client and server authentication contexts
4. Clear error handling for authentication failures

For troubleshooting authentication issues, see [Authentication Troubleshooting Guide](docs/auth-troubleshooting.md).
For information on recent authentication fixes, see [Authentication Fixes Documentation](docs/authentication-fixes.md).
For specific help with "Auth session missing" errors, see [Auth Session Troubleshooting Guide](docs/auth-session-troubleshooting.md).

## Design

The application features a modern, minimalist design inspired by high-end fitness applications. The core application (Dashboard, Workout Logging, Profile, etc.) utilizes a clean, **light theme** (e.g., `bg-gray-100` for main layout backgrounds, white for cards) for optimal readability and a modern feel. Specific introductory pages like the landing page or authentication screens may employ darker backgrounds or vibrant gradients for visual impact during those initial user flows.

Key design elements include:

- Modern landing page with gradient background and device mockups
- Intuitive form elements for collecting user preferences
- Consistent light theme across core application features
- Full-screen hero sections
- Clean typography with serif headings
- Motivational imagery
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Interactive muscle group visualization
- Strava-inspired run activity cards with route maps

## Run Tracking & Strava Integration

The application features a dedicated Run Logger page with Strava integration:

1. **Strava OAuth Integration**: Connect to Strava to import runs and activities
2. **Interactive Maps**: View run routes on interactive maps using Leaflet
3. **Strava-like Activity Cards**: Modern run activity cards displaying:
   - User information and run metadata
   - Run statistics (distance, pace, time)
   - Route visualization on a map
   - Segment and achievement information
4. **Manual Run Logging**: Add runs manually with distance, time, and location
5. **Dual View Options**: Toggle between card view (with maps) and table view
6. **Imperial Units**: All distances shown in miles, elevations in feet, and pace in minutes per mile
7. **Secure Token Management**: Server-side token refresh with automatic database updates

### Strava Security Architecture

The application implements a secure, server-side token management system:

- **Server-Side Token Refresh**: All token refresh operations happen on the server using `/api/strava/refresh-token`
- **Client-Side Safety**: `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` is never exposed to the browser
- **Automatic Token Updates**: Tokens are automatically refreshed and persisted to the database
- **User Authentication**: All token operations require proper user authentication
- **Transparent Operation**: Client components handle token refresh seamlessly without user intervention

For more information on run tracking features, see [Run Tracking Documentation](docs/run-tracking.md).
For details on the Strava token security implementation, see [ADR-001: Strava Token Refresh Server-Side Only](docs/adr/001-strava-token-refresh-server-side-only.md).

## Workout Tracking

The application provides robust workout tracking features, allowing users to log, view, and analyze their training progress. The yearly workout calendar on the `/workouts` page now offers a consolidated view, displaying both manually logged lifting sessions and synchronized Strava run activities.

1.  **Exercise Logging**: Record individual exercises or create workout groups with multiple exercises. The form includes fields for exercise name, sets, reps, weight, duration, date, and notes.
2.  **Unified Interface**: The workout logging page (`/workout/new`) features a clean UI consistent with the dashboard's light theme, using shared components for a seamless experience.
3.  **Workout History**: View past workouts and track progress over time (Functionality TBD/Located Elsewhere).
4.  **Performance Metrics**: Analyze workout trends and statistics via dashboard widgets.
5.  **Notes and Tags**: Add custom notes to each workout session or group.

### Workout Data Schema

- `exerciseName`: Name of the exercise performed
- `sets`: Number of sets completed
- `reps`: Repetitions per set
- `weight`: Weight used (in kg)
- `duration`: Time spent on the exercise (in minutes)
- `notes`: Optional notes about the workout
- `muscleGroup`: The primary muscle group targeted by the exercise

## Strava Integration

The application integrates with Strava to provide run tracking capabilities:

### Setup

1. Create a Strava API application at https://www.strava.com/settings/api
2. Add your Strava API credentials to the `.env.local` file:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID
   STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/run-logger/callback
   ```

### Features

1. **OAuth Authentication**: Securely connect to the Strava API using OAuth 2.0
2. **Run Listing**: View your recent runs from Strava with detailed metrics

   - Feet for elevation (instead of meters)
   - Minutes per mile for pace (instead of minutes per kilometer)

### Unit Conversion

The application includes a centralized unit conversion system in `src/lib/units.ts`:

1. **Metric to Imperial Conversion**: Automatically converts all API data from metric (meters) to imperial (miles/feet)
2. **Imperial to Metric Conversion**: Converts user inputs from imperial units to metric for API submissions
3. **Formatted Displays**: Provides formatted output strings with appropriate units (e.g., "3.14 mi", "150 ft")
4. **Pace Calculation**: Calculates and formats running pace in minutes per mile

For more information on the imperial units implementation, see the [Imperial Units Support ADR](docs/adr/imperial-units-support.md).

### Architecture

- **OAuth Flow**: Implementation of the authorization code flow for secure authentication
- **Token Storage**: Tokens stored securely in Supabase database with user profiles
- **Modular Components**: Reusable components for connecting to Strava, viewing runs, and logging runs
- **Unit Conversion**: Automatic conversion between Strava's metric units and display units (imperial)

### Data Schema Updates

The `profiles` table has been updated with the following fields to support Strava integration:

- `strava_access_token`: User's Strava access token
- `strava_refresh_token`: User's Strava refresh token
- `strava_token_expires_at`: Expiration timestamp for the access token
