# ADR 006: Auth Token Verification Improvement

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2023-07-01

## Context
The application was experiencing issues with the authentication token verification process in the server-side profile creation API. The original implementation used an anonymous Supabase client to verify the auth token, which led to inconsistent token verification results and potential security vulnerabilities.

Key issues identified:
1. Using an anonymous client for token verification could lead to insufficient permissions
2. Lack of proper error handling around the token verification process
3. Inconsistent behavior when dealing with token verification failures

## Decision
We have decided to improve the token verification process in the server-side API by:

1. Using a service role client instead of an anonymous client for token verification
2. Adding proper try/catch error handling around the token verification process
3. Providing more detailed error messages for different types of verification failures
4. Adding comprehensive logging to help with debugging authentication issues

**Implementation Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Using anonymous client for verification
const supabaseAnon = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
)

// After: Using service role client for verification
const supabaseVerify = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
)
```

Additionally, we've wrapped the token verification in a try/catch block to handle session-related errors that might occur during `setSession()` or `getUser()` calls.

## Consequences

### Positive
- More robust token verification process
- Clearer error messages for debugging
- Improved security by using the service role for verification
- Better error handling with specific try/catch blocks
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

### Negative
- Slightly more complex code with additional try/catch blocks
- Service role usage requires careful management to prevent misuse

### Neutral
- Need to ensure service role key is properly configured in all environments
- Additional logging might impact performance slightly but is valuable for debugging
