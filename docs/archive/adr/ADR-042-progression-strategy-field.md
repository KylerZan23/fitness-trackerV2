# ADR-042: Progression Strategy Field Implementation

## Status
**Implemented** - 2025-01-27

## Context

### Scientific Background
The previous program generation system provided static workout plans but lacked explicit guidance on how to apply progressive overload - the fundamental principle of training adaptation. Users received comprehensive programs detailing exercises, sets, reps, and RPE targets, but were left to determine progression strategies on their own.

Progressive overload is the cornerstone of all training adaptations, requiring systematic increases in training stimulus over time. Without clear progression guidance, users may:
- Plateau due to insufficient progression
- Overtrain due to excessive progression
- Apply inappropriate progression methods for their goals
- Lose motivation from unclear advancement pathways

### Current System Limitations
1. **Static Program Output**: Programs provided snapshots without progression guidance
2. **Implicit Progression**: Progressive overload principles were embedded but not explicit
3. **User Guesswork**: No clear instructions on week-to-week advancement
4. **Missed Educational Opportunity**: Users didn't learn progression principles
5. **Implementation Uncertainty**: Unclear how to apply scientific periodization concepts

### Research Foundation
- Progressive overload is essential for continued adaptations (Kraemer & Ratamess, 2004)
- Systematic progression planning improves long-term outcomes (Rhea et al., 2003)
- Explicit progression guidance enhances program adherence (Garber et al., 2011)
- Autoregulated progression optimizes individual responses (Helms et al., 2018)

## Decision

### Implementation Strategy
Added dedicated `progressionStrategy` fields to both `TrainingWeek` and `TrainingPhase` schemas, transforming static programs into dynamic training guides with explicit progression instructions.

### Technical Implementation

#### Schema Enhancements
```typescript
// TrainingWeek Schema Addition
const TrainingWeekSchema = z.object({
  // ... existing fields
  progressionStrategy: z.string().optional(),
})

// TrainingPhase Schema Addition  
const TrainingPhaseSchema = z.object({
  // ... existing fields
  progressionStrategy: z.string().optional(),
})
```

#### TypeScript Interface Updates
```typescript
interface TrainingWeek {
  // ... existing fields
  progressionStrategy?: string; // How to progress from previous week
}

interface TrainingPhase {
  // ... existing fields  
  progressionStrategy?: string; // Overall progression approach for this phase
}
```

#### Enhanced LLM Prompt Instructions
```typescript
**Progression Strategy Field - MANDATORY**: For each \`TrainingWeek\` and \`TrainingPhase\`, you MUST populate the \`progressionStrategy\` field with clear, actionable progression instructions:

*   **TrainingWeek.progressionStrategy**: Specific instructions for how to progress from the previous week
*   **TrainingPhase.progressionStrategy**: Overall progression approach for the entire phase
*   **Experience Level Considerations**: Complexity matches user capability and training background
```

### Progression Strategy Framework

#### Week-Level Progression Strategies
- **Week 1**: Baseline establishment and conservative starting points
- **Week 2**: Initial progression application (weight, volume, or intensity)
- **Week 3**: Continued progression following periodization model
- **Week 4**: Deload strategy for recovery and supercompensation

#### Phase-Level Progression Strategies
- **Linear Models**: Systematic weight increases with consistent volume
- **Undulating Models**: Volume accumulation followed by intensification
- **Autoregulated Models**: Progression based on daily readiness and feedback

#### Experience-Appropriate Complexity
- **Beginner**: Simple, conservative progressions with clear weight increments
- **Intermediate**: Systematic progressions integrating volume and intensity concepts
- **Advanced**: Autoregulated progressions based on readiness and performance feedback

### Example Progression Strategies

#### Beginner Linear Progression
**Phase Strategy**: "Simple linear weight increases each week while maintaining set/rep schemes and conservative RPE"
**Week Strategies**:
- Week 1: "Start conservatively at prescribed weights and RPE 6-7 targets"
- Week 2: "Add 2.5kg to lower body compounds, 1.25kg to upper body compounds if form was good"
- Week 3: "Continue progressive weight increases maintaining RPE 6-7"
- Week 4: "Reduce weights by 10% and focus on form refinement for deload"

#### Intermediate Undulating Periodization
**Phase Strategy**: "Progressive volume accumulation from MEV to MAV over 3 weeks, followed by deload"
**Week Strategies**:
- Week 1: "Establish baseline at MEV volumes (RPE 7-8)"
- Week 2: "Add 1-2 sets to primary muscle groups, progress toward MAV"
- Week 3: "Reach MAV volumes with RPE 8-9 intensification"
- Week 4: "Return to MEV volumes with RPE 5-6 for recovery"

#### Advanced Autoregulated Progression
**Phase Strategy**: "Autoregulated progression based on daily readiness and performance feedback"
**Week Strategies**:
- Week 1: "Start at competition movement focus with RPE 7-8"
- Week 2: "Progress based on daily readiness - add weight if RPE <7, maintain if RPE 7-8"
- Week 3: "Peak intensity with RPE 8-9, competition lift specificity"
- Week 4: "Active recovery with reduced volume and intensity for supercompensation"

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
