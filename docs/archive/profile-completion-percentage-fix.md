# Profile Completion Percentage Fix

## Issue Description

The onboarding review page was showing incorrect completion percentages:
- **Problem**: Displayed "108%" and "13 of 12 questions answered"
- **Expected**: Maximum 100% and accurate question counts

## Root Cause Analysis

The `calculateCompletionStats` function in `ReviewSummary.tsx` had two critical issues:

### 1. Hardcoded Question Lists
The function manually listed only 12 questions (6 required + 6 optional) instead of using the actual QuestionRegistry which contains **16 questions**.

**Missing Questions:**
- `weightUnit` (required)
- `sportSpecificDetails` (conditional required)
- `exercisePreferences` (optional)
- `injuriesLimitations` (optional)

### 2. Incorrect Answer Counting
The function counted ALL keys in the answers object, including fields that weren't actual questions, leading to inflated completion counts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Question Registry Integration
```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded lists
const requiredQuestions = ['primaryGoal', 'trainingFrequencyDays', ...] // Only 6
const optionalQuestions = ['secondaryGoal', 'squat1RMEstimate', ...] // Only 6

// After: Use actual registry
const allQuestionIds = ONBOARDING_QUESTIONS.map(q => q.id) // All 16 questions
```

### 2. Accurate Answer Filtering
```typescript
// Before: Count all answer keys
const answeredQuestions = Object.keys(answers).filter(key => {
  const value = answers[key as keyof OnboardingFormData]
  return value !== undefined && value !== null && value !== ''
}).length

// After: Only count actual questions
const answeredQuestions = allQuestionIds.filter(questionId => {
  const value = answers[questionId as keyof OnboardingFormData]
  return value !== undefined && value !== null && value !== '' && 
         (Array.isArray(value) ? value.length > 0 : true)
}).length
```

### 3. Percentage Capping
```typescript
// Added Math.min to prevent >100%
const percentage = Math.min(100, Math.round((answeredQuestions / totalQuestions) * 100))
```

### 4. Complete Summary Sections
Updated the summary display to include all missing questions:
- Added `weightUnit` to Training Preferences
- Added `sportSpecificDetails` to Fitness Goals  
- Added new "Preferences & Limitations" section for `exercisePreferences` and `injuriesLimitations`

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/onboarding/ReviewSummary.tsx`**
   - Fixed `calculateCompletionStats` function
   - Added import for `ONBOARDING_QUESTIONS`
   - Updated summary sections to include all questions

## Validation

- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ Progress calculation now uses actual question registry
- ✅ Percentage capped at 100% maximum
- ✅ All 16 questions properly counted and displayed
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Accurate progress indication (no more >100%)
- **Data Integrity**: Proper question counting based on actual registry
- **Maintainability**: Automatic updates when questions are added/removed from registry
- **Completeness**: All questions now visible in review summary
