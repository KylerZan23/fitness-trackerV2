# Authentication Loop Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing an authentication loop issue where users were unable to log in because:

1. The middleware was detecting an existing authentication token in cookies
2. Even if the token was invalid or expired, the middleware was redirecting to the dashboard
3. The dashboard would then redirect back to login (due to invalid token)
4. This created an infinite loop between login and dashboard pages

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive fix with several components:

### 1. Force Login Parameter

Added a `force_login=true` URL parameter that allows direct access to the login page, bypassing authentication checks:

```typescript
// In middleware.ts
const isForceLogin = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('force_login') === 'true'

if (
  isForceLogin &&
  (request.nextUrl.pathname === '/login' || request.nextUrl.pathname === '/signup')
) {
  console.log('Force login parameter detected, bypassing authentication check')
  return response
}
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling

Enhanced error handling in the middleware to clear auth cookies when errors occur:

```typescript
catch (err) {
  console.error('Middleware error:', err)

  // If there's an error in the middleware, we should clear the auth cookie
  // to prevent authentication loops
  const response = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login?force_login=true', request.url))

  // Clear the auth cookie
  response.cookies.delete('sb-oimcnjdkcqwdltdpkmnu-auth-token')

  return response
}
```

### 3. Secure Authentication Verification

Updated all authentication checks to use `getUser()` instead of `getSession()` for secure token verification:

```typescript
// Use getUser() instead of getSession() for secure authentication verification
// This verifies the token with the Supabase Auth server
const {
  data: { user },
  error: userError,
} = await supabase.auth.getUser()
```

### 4. Complete Sign Out Functionality

Added a more thorough sign-out process that clears all auth-related data:

```typescript
// Sign out from Supabase
await supabase.auth.signOut()

// Clear any local storage items related to auth
localStorage.removeItem('supabase.auth.token')

// Refresh the page with force_login parameter
window.location.href = '/login?force_login=true'
```

## How It Works

1. When a user tries to log in but encounters an authentication loop:

   - They can access `/login?force_login=true` directly
   - This bypasses all authentication checks in the middleware
   - The login page shows a "Fresh Login" message

2. When a user logs out:

   - All auth tokens are properly cleared
   - The user is redirected to `/login?force_login=true`
   - This ensures they can access the login page without being redirected

3. When authentication errors occur:
   - Auth cookies are automatically cleared
   - The user is redirected to `/login?force_login=true`
   - This breaks any potential authentication loops

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix is working:

1. Try logging in with valid credentials
2. You should be redirected to the dashboard
3. If you encounter any issues, access `/login?force_login=true` directly
4. This should allow you to log in without being caught in a redirect loop
