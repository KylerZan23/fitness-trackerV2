# ADR-031: Neural Program Display System Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Coach Neural requires a premium program display system that differentiates from basic AI trainers through sophisticated branding, detailed exercise rationale, and intelligent progression tracking. The system must work with the simplified Neural type system while providing a premium user experience that justifies AI coaching value.

## Decision

Implement a four-component system for Neural program display:

1. **NeuralLoadingState** - Branded loading animation with brain/AI theme
2. **NeuralProgramDisplay** - Main program overview with Neural branding
3. **NeuralWorkoutCard** - Individual workout display with exercise details
4. **NeuralExerciseDetail** - Detailed exercise information with scientific rationale

### Component Architecture

```
NeuralProgramDisplay
├── Shows selected workout in NeuralWorkoutCard
└── NeuralWorkoutCard
    ├── Shows selected exercise in NeuralExerciseDetail
    └── NeuralExerciseDetail
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with premium loading states that build anticipation
2. **Neural Branding Consistency**: Blue-purple gradients, Brain icons, scientific terminology
3. **String-Based Data Flexibility**: Work with Neural's AI-optimized flexible data format
4. **Mobile-First Responsive**: Touch-friendly interactions and mobile optimization
5. **Accessibility First**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Rationale

### Premium Branding Strategy
- Consistent blue-purple gradient scheme reinforces Neural's AI identity
- Brain icons with animated neural network effects convey intelligence
- Scientific terminology and evidence citations build credibility
- Loading states that build excitement for AI coaching experience

### Component Separation Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Components can be used independently
- **Testing**: Easier to test isolated components
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and code splitting opportunities

### Neural Type System Integration
- Uses flexible string-based exercise data (reps: "8-12", load: "15-20lb")
- Accommodates AI-generated content with natural language descriptions
- Backward compatible with existing workout logging system
- Enables future AI enhancement without breaking changes

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information hierarchy from program → workout → exercise
- **Autoregulation Support**: RPE guidance with scientific explanations
- **Timer Integration**: Built-in rest period and set timers
- **Coaching Context**: Neural's insights and scientific rationale at each level

## Implementation Details

### Component Responsibilities

#### NeuralLoadingState
- **Purpose**: Build anticipation and convey premium AI coaching
- **Features**: Animated brain icon, analysis steps, time estimation
- **Design**: Neural branding with gradient backgrounds and micro-interactions

#### NeuralProgramDisplay
- **Purpose**: Program overview with workout selection
- **Features**: Neural insights, progression notes, workout grid
- **Navigation**: Transitions to NeuralWorkoutCard on workout selection

#### NeuralWorkoutCard
- **Purpose**: Workout details with exercise organization
- **Features**: Exercise groups (warmup, main, finisher), timer integration
- **Navigation**: Transitions to NeuralExerciseDetail on exercise selection

#### NeuralExerciseDetail
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive exercise information and guidance
- **Features**: Tabbed interface (overview, form, progression), RPE guidance
- **Integration**: Video placeholders, scientific rationale, coaching tips

### Data Flow
1. Load program data via Neural API
2. Display NeuralLoadingState during generation
3. Show NeuralProgramDisplay with workout selection
4. Navigate to NeuralWorkoutCard for selected workout
5. Show NeuralExerciseDetail for selected exercise
6. Integrate with existing workout logging system

### Design System Integration
- Uses existing UI components (Card, Button, Badge)
- Leverages Tailwind custom brand colors
- Maintains consistency with Lucide React icons
- Follows established animation patterns

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Premium User Experience**: Differentiates Neural from basic AI trainers
- **Scientific Credibility**: Evidence-based presentation builds trust
- **Flexible Data Handling**: Works with AI-generated content
- **Maintainable Architecture**: Clear component separation and responsibilities
- **Performance Optimized**: Component-based architecture enables optimization

### Negative
- **Additional Complexity**: Four new components to maintain
- **Neural Dependency**: Tightly coupled to Neural branding and data format
- **Feature Scope**: Rich feature set may impact initial development speed

### Risk Mitigation
- **Phased Implementation**: Can deploy components incrementally
- **Fallback Support**: Components gracefully handle missing data
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration prevents runtime errors
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit and integration tests for each component

## Alternatives Considered

### Single Monolithic Component
- **Rejected**: Too complex for maintenance and testing
- **Issues**: Poor separation of concerns, difficult code splitting

### Generic Workout Display Components
- **Rejected**: Doesn't support Neural's premium positioning
- **Issues**: Lacks scientific rationale and AI coaching context

### Server-Side Rendering Only
- **Rejected**: Limits interactive features like timers
- **Issues**: Poor user experience for workout progression
