# ADR-020: Modern Onboarding Types Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Complements:** ADR-019 (Neural Type System Architecture)

## Context

With the implementation of the Neural type system, we needed a modern, type-safe onboarding system that could seamlessly integrate with the new architecture while providing advanced TypeScript patterns for improved developer experience and data integrity.

The existing onboarding types were basic and lacked:

1. **Strong Type Safety**: No branded types or advanced validation
2. **Modern TypeScript Patterns**: Missing conditional types, template literals, and utility types
3. **Neural Integration**: No seamless conversion to Neural format
4. **Comprehensive Validation**: Limited runtime type checking and schema validation
5. **Developer Experience**: Poor IntelliSense support and error detection

## Decision

We are implementing a comprehensive **Modern Onboarding Types Architecture** that leverages advanced TypeScript patterns and integrates seamlessly with the Neural type system.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Type Safety First**: Branded types and compile-time guarantees
2. **Modern TypeScript**: Advanced patterns for better developer experience
3. **Neural Integration**: Seamless data transformation and compatibility
4. **Comprehensive Validation**: Multi-layer validation (compile + runtime)
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Support for legacy onboarding data

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Branded Types for ID Safety
```typescript
declare const __brand: unique symbol
type Brand<K, T> = K & { [__brand]: T }

export type UserId = Brand<string, 'UserId'>
export type QuestionId = Brand<string, 'QuestionId'>
export type CategoryId = Brand<string, 'CategoryId'>
```

**Rationale**: Prevents accidental mixing of different ID types, providing compile-time safety.

#### 2. Const Assertions for Immutable Enums
```typescript
export const FitnessGoals = {
  MUSCLE_GENERAL: 'Muscle Gain: General',
  MUSCLE_HYPERTROPHY: 'Muscle Gain: Hypertrophy Focus',
  STRENGTH_POWERLIFTING: 'Strength Gain: Powerlifting Peak',
  // ... more goals
} as const
```

**Rationale**: Provides better type inference than traditional enums while maintaining immutability.

#### 3. Conditional Types for Advanced Flow Management
```typescript
type RequiredQuestionIds<T extends readonly Question[]> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends Question & { isOptional?: false | undefined } 
    ? T[K]['id'] : never
}[number]
```

**Rationale**: Enables compile-time validation of question flow dependencies.

#### 4. Comprehensive Validation System
```typescript
export const OnboardingSchemas = {
  fitnessGoal: z.enum(Object.values(FitnessGoals) as [FitnessGoal, ...FitnessGoal[]]),
  trainingDays: z.number().int().min(2).max(7),
  // ... more schemas
}

export const OnboardingTypeGuards = {
  isValidFitnessGoal: (value: any): value is FitnessGoal => { /*...*/ },
  isCompleteOnboardingData: (data: any): data is OnboardingData => { /*...*/ }
}
```

**Rationale**: Multi-layer validation ensures data integrity at both compile-time and runtime.

#### 5. Neural Integration Utilities
```typescript
export const OnboardingUtils = {
  toNeuralFormat: (data: OnboardingFormData): NeuralOnboardingData => {
    const goalMapping: Record<FitnessGoal, NeuralOnboardingData['primaryFocus']> = {
      [FitnessGoals.MUSCLE_GENERAL]: 'hypertrophy',
      [FitnessGoals.STRENGTH_POWERLIFTING]: 'strength',
      // ... intelligent mapping
    }
    // ... conversion logic
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Provides seamless, type-safe conversion between onboarding and Neural formats.
