# ADR-047: Refined Mesocycle Progression Strategy Implementation

## Status
**Implemented** - 2025-01-28

## Context

### Scientific Foundation
Traditional progressive overload approaches often emphasize linear weight increases as the primary progression method. However, recent research in periodization science demonstrates that **volume progression** (increasing sets and reps) can be more effective for hypertrophy and sustainable strength development, particularly during accumulation phases of training.

### Current System Limitations
The existing progression strategy provided general guidance but lacked specificity regarding the **hierarchy of progression methods**:
1. **Unclear Progression Priority**: No clear guidance on whether to increase weight, sets, or reps first
2. **Suboptimal Volume Accumulation**: Weight increases during accumulation phases can interfere with optimal volume progression
3. **Missing Mesocycle Context**: Lack of guidance for transitioning between training blocks
4. **Generic Progression Examples**: Same progression approach regardless of training phase

### Research-Based Rationale
- **Volume-Driven Hypertrophy**: Set volume is the primary driver of muscle growth when intensity is adequate (Schoenfeld et al., 2017)
- **Progressive Volume Overload**: Adding sets before increasing load allows for better fatigue management and adaptation (Helms et al., 2018)
- **Periodized Volume Progression**: Systematic volume accumulation followed by intensification produces superior results (Zourdos et al., 2016)
- **Block Periodization**: Alternating volume and intensity focus optimizes long-term progression (Issurin, 2010)

## Decision

### Implementation Strategy
Implemented a specific **Mesocycle Progression Strategy** that overrides general advice and provides clear hierarchy for progression methods throughout different phases of training.

### Mesocycle Progression Hierarchy

#### Weeks 1-3 (Accumulation Phase)
**Primary Progression Method**: Volume increases through systematic set addition
- **Step 1**: Add reps within target rep range until TOP of range is achieved for all sets
- **Step 2**: Once top rep range achieved for all sets, ADD ONE SET to that exercise the following week
- **Step 3**: Weight increases should be MINIMAL during this phase (only when form breakdown occurs)

**Scientific Rationale**:
- Maximizes muscle growth stimulus through volume accumulation
- Allows better fatigue management and recovery adaptation
- Preserves movement quality during volume increases
- Creates sustainable progression that doesn't rely solely on strength gains

#### Week 3 (Intensification/Final Volume Week)
**Goal**: Reach Maximum Adaptive Volume (MAV) while maintaining quality
- Focus on completing volume progression to MAV levels
- Maintain RPE targets while achieving maximum productive volume
- Prepare for deload by pushing volume to sustainable limits

**Scientific Rationale**:
- MAV represents the highest volume that can be recovered from
- Final volume week creates overreaching stimulus for supercompensation
- Sets up optimal deload timing before volume becomes counterproductive

#### Week 4 (Deload Phase)
**Goal**: Recovery and preparation for next mesocycle
- Reduce sets to Week 1 levels (MEV)
- Decrease intensity to RPE 5-6
- Prepare for next block with potential weight increases

#### After Mesocycle Completion
**Primary Progression Method**: Weight increases with same volume structure
- Use same set and rep scheme from previous block's Week 1
- Increase weight for established volume structure
- Return to rep/set progression within new weight ranges

**Scientific Rationale**:
- Alternates volume and intensity focus for optimal long-term progression
- Prevents stagnation by changing primary progression stimulus
- Maintains training variety while preserving systematic progression

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced AI Prompt Instructions

#### Mesocycle Progression Strategy
```typescript
**Mesocycle Progression Strategy (Overrides General Advice) - MANDATORY**:
- **Weeks 1-3 (Accumulation)**: PRIMARY progression through SET ADDITION, not weight
  - Step 1: Add reps within target range until top achieved
  - Step 2: Add ONE SET when top range achieved for all sets
  - Step 3: MINIMAL weight increases during accumulation
- **Week 3 (Final Volume)**: Complete progression to MAV
- **After Mesocycle**: Next block uses weight increases with same volume structure
```

#### Specific Week-by-Week Examples
```typescript
**TrainingWeek.progressionStrategy Examples**:
- **Week 1**: "Add reps within target range (8-12 → aim for 10-12). Minimal weight adjustments."
- **Week 2**: "If top range achieved last week, add 1 set. Example: 3x8-12 → 4x8-12 if all sets reached 12 reps."
- **Week 3**: "Final volume progression week. Add remaining sets to reach MAV."
- **Week 4**: "Deload: Reduce sets to Week 1 levels, RPE 5-6. Prepare for next mesocycle."
```

#### Enhanced Volume Progression Framework
```typescript
**Volume Progression Framework**:
- **Week 1**: Start at MEV, focus on rep progression within ranges
- **Week 2**: Add sets for exercises that achieved top rep range
- **Week 3**: Complete progression to MAV through remaining set additions
- **Week 4**: Return to MEV for deload and recovery
```

### Updated Periodization Models

#### Intermediate/Advanced Users
```typescript
**4-Week Volume-Focused Mesocycle Model**:
- Week 1: MEV start, rep progression focus, minimal weight increases
- Week 2: Set addition for qualified exercises, continued rep progression
- Week 3: Complete MAV progression, final volume increases
- Week 4: Deload to MEV, prepare for next block weight increases
```

#### Beginner Users
```typescript
**Volume-Focused Progression with Conservative Targets**:
- Primary method: Rep progression then set addition
- Focus on mastering rep ranges before adding volume
- Weight increases only when form quality maintained throughout range
- Conservative RPE 6-7 for movement pattern learning
```

### Integration with Existing Systems

#### Tiered Exercise Selection Compatibility
- Volume progression applied within each tier appropriately
- Tier 1 exercises may progress more conservatively due to complexity
- Tier 2-3 exercises can utilize full volume progression potential

#### SFR Optimization Maintenance
- Volume progression preserves SFR principles by avoiding premature weight increases
- Set addition allows continued stimulus without excessive fatigue costs
- Maintains equipment and injury constraint handling

#### Weak Point Targeting Integration
- Volume progression particularly beneficial for accessory work targeting weak points
- Allows systematic development of lagging muscle groups through set addition
- Maintains weak point exercise priority within volume progression framework
