# ADR-003: AI Coach Program Adherence & Feedback Loop Integration

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-06

## Context
The AI Coach was providing generic fitness advice without awareness of the user's specific AI-generated training program or their adherence to it. This created a disconnect between the personalized programs users received and the coaching they got, reducing the overall effectiveness and user engagement of the fitness tracking system.

## Decision
We integrated the AI Coach with the user's active training program and implemented real-time adherence tracking to provide contextual, program-aware coaching recommendations.

### Core Integration Components

#### 1. Active Program Context Integration
- **Implementation**: AI Coach now fetches user's active `TrainingProgramWithId` via `getActiveTrainingProgram()`
- **Context Awareness**: Understands current phase, week, and today's planned workout
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles users without active programs

#### 2. Real-time Adherence Tracking
- **Implementation**: New `getProgramAdherenceData()` function analyzes workout completion
- **Data Source**: Queries `workout_groups` table using program linking fields
- **Metrics Tracked**: Weekly completion count, last workout status, today's plan
- **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing

#### 3. Program-Aware LLM Prompting
- **Implementation**: Enhanced prompt with structured program context section
- **Priority System**: Program adherence takes precedence over general advice
- **Contextual Responses**: Different coaching based on adherence patterns
- **Behavioral Adaptation**: Acknowledges, encourages, or redirects based on user behavior

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

#### Data Flow Architecture
```
User Request → Fetch Profile → Fetch Active Program → Analyze Adherence → 
Generate Context → Enhanced LLM Prompt → Contextual Coaching → Cache Result
```

#### Database Integration Strategy
- **Minimal Queries**: Only 2 additional queries (program + adherence)
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverages existing workout_groups linking system
- **Efficient Indexing**: Uses existing indexes on linking fields
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with general coaching if program data unavailable

#### Caching Strategy
- **Cache Invalidation**: Added `programAdherence` to data signature
- **Performance Maintenance**: Prevents unnecessary LLM calls
- **Context Sensitivity**: Cache updates when program status changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing cache mechanism extended

### MVP Implementation Approach
- **Current Position Logic**: Assumes first phase, first week for simplicity
- **Linear Progression**: Simple week-by-week advancement model
- **Start Date Handling**: Graceful handling of NULL start_date fields
- **Future Enhancement Path**: Architecture supports sophisticated date-based progression

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Contextual Relevance**: Coaching aligns with user's specific program
- **Motivation Enhancement**: Acknowledgment of completed workouts increases engagement
- **Clear Guidance**: Users know exactly what to do today based on their program
- **Recovery Support**: Helpful suggestions when users fall behind schedule
- **Confidence Building**: Understanding of program progression and purpose

#### System Integration Benefits
- **Unified Experience**: AI Coach and Program Generation work together seamlessly
- **Data Utilization**: Maximizes value from existing workout logging data
- **Behavioral Insights**: System learns from user adherence patterns
- **Scalable Architecture**: Foundation for advanced coaching features

#### Technical Advantages
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal additional database load
- **Error Resilient**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Maintainable Code**: Clean separation of concerns with helper functions
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new adherence metrics and coaching logic

### Potential Challenges

#### Data Dependency
- **User Input Quality**: Effectiveness depends on accurate workout logging
- **Program Linking**: Requires users to properly link workouts to programs
- **Data Completeness**: Some users may have incomplete adherence data

#### Complexity Management
- **Logic Complexity**: More complex decision trees for coaching recommendations
- **Edge Cases**: Multiple scenarios to handle (new users, program transitions, etc.)
- **Testing Overhead**: More comprehensive testing required for various adherence states

#### Performance Considerations
- **Query Load**: Additional database queries per AI Coach request
- **Cache Complexity**: More sophisticated cache invalidation logic
- **Response Time**: Slight increase in processing time for enhanced features

### Neutral Impacts
- **Token Usage**: Slightly longer prompts increase LLM API costs
- **Storage**: Minimal additional data storage requirements
- **Maintenance**: Regular monitoring of adherence logic accuracy needed

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Post-Processing Approach
- **Rejected**: Would lose contextual coherence in coaching recommendations
- **Issue**: Difficult to maintain natural conversation flow
- **Limitation**: Cannot adapt coaching tone based on program context

### 2. Separate Adherence Service
- **Rejected**: Added unnecessary architectural complexity
- **Issue**: Would require additional API calls and data synchronization
- **Limitation**: Harder to maintain real-time consistency

### 3. Client-Side Program Integration
- **Rejected**: Security and performance concerns
- **Issue**: Sensitive program data exposed to client
- **Limitation**: Increased client-side complexity and data transfer

### 4. Simplified Adherence Tracking
- **Rejected**: Would not provide sufficient context for quality coaching
- **Issue**: Generic adherence metrics insufficient for personalized coaching
- **Limitation**: Missed opportunity for behavioral insights

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `src/app/_actions/aiCoachActions.ts` - Enhanced with program integration
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_AI_COACH_ADHERENCE.md` - Detailed implementation documentation
- `README.md` - Updated with new AI Coach capabilities

### Key Interfaces Added
```typescript
interface ProgramAdherenceData {
  programName: string
  currentPhase: string
  currentWeek: string
  todaysPlannedWorkout: string
  workoutsCompletedThisWeek: number
  lastLoggedWorkoutVsPlan: string
}
```

### Database Schema Utilization
- **Existing Tables**: `training_programs`, `workout_groups`
- **Linking Fields**: `linked_program_id`, `linked_program_phase_index`, `linked_program_week_index`, `linked_program_day_of_week`
- **Indexes**: Leverages existing indexes for efficient queries

### Error Handling Strategy
```typescript
// Graceful fallback pattern used throughout
try {
  activeProgram = await getActiveTrainingProgram()
  if (activeProgram) {
    programAdherence = await getProgramAdherenceData(supabase, userId, activeProgram)
  }
} catch (programFetchError) {
  console.warn(`Error fetching active program for user ${userId}`, programFetchError)
  // Continue with general coaching
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Short-term Enhancements
- **Date-based Progression**: Implement proper start_date logic for accurate phase/week calculation
- **Exercise-level Tracking**: Track completion of specific exercises within workouts
- **Streak Metrics**: Monitor consecutive workout completion patterns
