# ADR-052: Enhanced Program Display Components Implementation

## Status
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (2025-01-15)

## Context
Following the implementation of enhanced program validation schema (ADR-051), we needed to create comprehensive UI components to visualize and interact with the advanced, science-based training program data. The existing program display was limited to basic program structure and lacked the sophisticated features needed to showcase the enhanced program information including volume distribution, autoregulation protocols, weak point interventions, and periodization details.

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive suite of enhanced program display components that provide:

### 1. New Enhanced Components
- **VolumeDistributionChart**: Visual volume vs landmarks representation
- **ScientificRationale**: Expandable evidence-based explanations  
- **AutoregulationGuidelines**: Interactive RPE implementation guide
- **WeakPointInterventions**: Targeted correction protocols with tracking
- **PeriodizationOverview**: Phase structure and progression visualization

### 2. Updated Existing Components  
- **ExerciseListDisplay**: Enhanced with rationale, tiers, and RPE targets
- **ProgramPhaseDisplay**: Added periodization context
- **Program Page**: Integrated all enhanced components with mock data

### 3. Interactive Features
- Volume tracking against individual landmarks
- RPE logging with autoregulation feedback
- Progress tracking for weak point interventions
- Scientific rationale exploration with citations

## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
