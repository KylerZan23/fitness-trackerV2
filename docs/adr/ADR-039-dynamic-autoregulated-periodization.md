# ADR-039: Dynamic Autoregulated Periodization Enhancement

## Status
**Implemented** - 2025-01-27

## Context

### Scientific Background
The existing program generation system in `aiProgramActions.ts` relied primarily on linear progression models and percentage-based loading for all users. While this approach works for beginners, modern evidence-based training programming utilizes autoregulation via Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and Reps in Reserve (RIR) to optimize training adaptations, particularly for intermediate and advanced trainees.

### Current System Limitations
1. **Limited periodization structure**: No systematic mesocycle progression beyond basic linear increases
2. **Insufficient autoregulation**: Minimal RPE/RIR guidance for load selection
3. **Experience-level mismatch**: Same progression approach for all experience levels
4. **Missing deload programming**: No systematic recovery phases
5. **Suboptimal for non-beginners**: Linear progression becomes less effective after initial adaptations

### Research Foundation
- Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP) shows superior strength and hypertrophy outcomes vs. linear periodization in trained individuals (Rhea et al., 2002; Peterson et al., 2008)
- RPE-based autoregulation allows for real-time intensity adjustments based on daily readiness (Helms et al., 2018)
- Systematic deload periods are crucial for supercompensation and injury prevention (Mujika & Padilla, 2003)

## Decision

### Implementation Strategy
Enhanced the `constructLLMPrompt` function in `src/app/_actions/aiProgramActions.ts` to include dynamic, autoregulated periodization instructions based on user experience level.

### Periodization Models

#### For Intermediate/Advanced Users (6+ months experience)
**4-Week Undulating Periodization Model:**
- **Week 1 (Volume Accumulation)**: RPE 7-8 (2-3 RIR), focus on volume and movement quality
- **Week 2 (Volume Accumulation)**: RPE 7-8, slight load increases, additional accessory sets
- **Week 3 (Intensification)**: RPE 8-9 (1-2 RIR), reduced accessory volume, intensity focus
- **Week 4 (Deload)**: RPE 5-6 (4-5 RIR), 40-50% volume reduction for recovery

#### For Beginner Users (<6 months experience)
**Linear Progression Model:**
- Consistent set/rep schemes across all weeks
- Progressive weight increases: +2.5kg/5lbs for lower body, +1.25kg/2.5lbs for upper body
- Conservative RPE targets: 6-7 (3-4 RIR)
- Emphasis on technique mastery and movement quality

### Enhanced Weight Prescription
1. **Systematic RPE guidance**: All exercises receive appropriate RPE/RIR targets
2. **Autoregulation instructions**: Clear guidance for load selection when 1RM unavailable
3. **Educational components**: RPE/RIR explanations included in program notes
4. **Experience-specific targeting**: Different intensity ranges based on training experience

### Key Enhancements Made

#### 1. Structure & Content Section

    *   **For Intermediate/Advanced Users (6+ months experience) - Implement a 4-Week Undulating Periodization Model**:
        *   **Week 1 (Volume Accumulation):** Main compound lifts should target RPE 7-8 (2-3 Reps in Reserve)...
        *   **Week 2 (Volume Accumulation):** Increase load slightly on main lifts while maintaining RPE 7-8...
        *   **Week 3 (Intensification):** Increase load on main lifts to target RPE 8-9 (1-2 Reps in Reserve)...
        *   **Week 4 (Deload):** Reduce total sets by 40-50% and intensity to RPE 5-6 (4-5 Reps in Reserve)...

        *   Keep set/rep schemes consistent across all weeks...
        *   Target RPE 6-7 (3-4 Reps in Reserve) to prioritize technique development...
```

#### 2. Weight Prescription & Autoregulation Section
```typescript
// Enhanced with systematic RPE/RIR guidance
6.  **Weight Prescription & Autoregulation**:
    *   **CRITICAL**: Always include the target RPE in the \`rpe\` field and provide RPE/RIR guidance...
    *   **For exercises where a direct 1RM is not applicable or not provided by the user, you MUST provide RPE or RIR guidance for autoregulation**...
    *   **RPE/RIR Education in Program Notes**: For users unfamiliar with RPE, include brief explanations...
```

#### 3. General Advice Enhancement
```typescript
// Added periodization explanation requirements
*   For the \`generalAdvice\` field: Provide a brief (3-4 sentences) explanation of the program's overall structure, periodization approach...
    *   For Intermediate/Advanced: Explain the 4-week undulating periodization (volume accumulation → intensification → deload) and RPE-based autoregulation
    *   For Beginners: Explain the linear progression approach and emphasis on technique development with conservative RPE targets
