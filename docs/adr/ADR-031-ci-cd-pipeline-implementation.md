# ADR-031: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

NeuralLift needs to transition from a project to a scalable, reliable product. Manual testing and deployment processes pose significant risks and don't scale effectively. A robust CI/CD pipeline is essential for maintaining code quality, preventing regressions, and enabling confident deployments.

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with the following components:

### CI Pipeline (Pull Request Validation)

- **Automated Quality Checks**: Linting, formatting, unit tests, build validation
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright tests on multiple browsers
- **Security Scanning**: Dependency vulnerabilities and CodeQL analysis
- **Coverage Reporting**: Unit test coverage tracking
- **Parallel Execution**: Jobs run in parallel for faster feedback

### CD Pipeline (Deployment)

- **Staging Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging on main branch push
- **Production Deployment**: Manual trigger with approval gates
- **Database Migrations**: Automated migration handling with validation
- **Health Checks**: Post-deployment verification and smoke tests
- **Rollback Capability**: Database backups and deployment rollback procedures

### Quality Gates

- All CI checks must pass before PR merge
- Staging deployment must succeed before production eligibility
- Database migrations validated in staging first
- Health checks must pass post-deployment

## Technical Implementation

### Workflow Structure

```
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml              # Pull request validation
├── cd-staging.yml      # Staging deployment
└── cd-production.yml   # Production deployment
```

### Environment Strategy

- **Staging**: Preview deployments with staging database
- **Production**: Manual deployment with production database
- **Environment Parity**: Consistent configuration across environments

### Secret Management

- Supabase credentials (staging and production)
- Vercel deployment tokens
- Database access credentials
- Environment-specific configurations

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Automated Quality Assurance**: Prevents broken code from reaching production
- **Faster Feedback**: Developers get immediate feedback on code changes
- **Consistent Deployments**: Standardized deployment process reduces human error
- **Confidence in Releases**: Comprehensive testing before production deployment
- **Scalability**: Pipeline supports team growth and increased deployment frequency
- **Observability**: Clear deployment status and comprehensive reporting

### Negative

- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Requires configuration of secrets and environments
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand new workflow processes
- **Dependency on GitHub Actions**: Platform lock-in for CI/CD
- **Cost Considerations**: Potential costs for GitHub Actions minutes

### Risk Mitigation

- **Database Safety**: Automated backups before migrations
- **Gradual Rollout**: Manual production approval initially
- **Environment Testing**: Staging mirrors production configuration
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and deployment status tracking

## Implementation Requirements

### GitHub Secrets Setup

```
# Staging Environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_STAGING
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_STAGING
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN_STAGING
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF_STAGING
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD_STAGING

# Production Environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_PROD
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_PROD
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN_PROD
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF_PROD
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD_PROD

# Deployment
VERCEL_TOKEN
VERCEL_ORG_ID
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
```

### Team Workflow Changes

1. **Pull Requests**: All changes must go through PR with CI validation
2. **Main Branch Protection**: Require CI checks before merge
3. **Staging Review**: Test changes on staging before production
4. **Production Deployment**: Manual trigger with approval and reason

## Success Metrics

- CI pipeline execution time < 5 minutes
- CD pipeline execution time < 10 minutes
- Test coverage maintained > 80%
- Deployment success rate > 99%
- Mean time to recovery < 30 minutes

## Future Enhancements

- Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Performance testing integration (Lighthouse CI)
- Feature flag management
- Multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
