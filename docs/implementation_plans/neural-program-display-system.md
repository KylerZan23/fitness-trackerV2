# Neural Program Display System Implementation Plan

## Overview

Create a premium, scientific program display system for Coach Neural that differentiates from basic AI trainers through sophisticated branding, detailed exercise rationale, and intelligent progression tracking.

## Analysis of Requirements

### Existing System Understanding
- **Neural Type System**: Uses simplified `TrainingProgram`, `Workout`, and `Exercise` interfaces (src/types/neural.ts)
- **Branding**: Blue-purple gradient scheme with Brain icon for Neural identity
- **Design System**: Tailwind with custom brand colors, rounded-xl cards, and sophisticated animations
- **Loading Patterns**: Animated pulse loading states with branded elements

### Neural Type System Integration
```typescript
interface Exercise {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  targetMuscles: string[];
  sets: number;
  reps: string; // "8-12" - flexible format
  load: string; // "15-20lb" - natural language
  rest: string; // "90 seconds" - human readable
  rpe: string; // "7-8" - flexible range
  notes?: string;
  formCues?: string;
  rationale?: string;
  videoUrl?: string;
}

interface Workout {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  duration: number;
  focus: string;
  warmup: Exercise[];
  mainExercises: Exercise[];
  finisher?: Exercise[];
  totalEstimatedTime: number;
}

interface TrainingProgram {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  programName: string;
  weekNumber: number;
  workouts: Workout[];
  progressionNotes: string;
  neuralInsights: string;
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **Program Loading**: NeuralLoadingState → NeuralProgramDisplay
2. **Workout Selection**: NeuralProgramDisplay → NeuralWorkoutCard
3. **Exercise Details**: NeuralWorkoutCard → NeuralExerciseDetail
4. **Progress Tracking**: Integrated across all components

### State Management
- Use React hooks for local state
- Props drilling for data sharing
- Optional context for complex interactions

### Integration Points
- Neural API service for program data
- Existing workout logging system
- Progress tracking database
- Video content management

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for exercise details
- Memoized components for workout cards
- Optimized animations for mobile devices
- Progressive image loading for videos

## Assumptions and Uncertainties

### Confirmed Assumptions
- Neural type system provides flexible string-based data
- Existing UI components (Card, Button, Badge) are available
- Tailwind with custom brand colors is configured
- Lucide React icons including Brain are available

### Uncertainties to Address
- Video integration requirements and content source
- Real-time progress tracking implementation
- Offline functionality requirements
- Push notification integration for workout reminders

## Architectural Decisions

### ADR-031: Neural Program Display Component Architecture
- **Decision**: Create dedicated Neural-branded components separate from generic workout components
- **Rationale**: Maintains premium branding and allows for specialized features
- **Consequences**: Requires additional maintenance but provides superior user experience

### ADR-032: String-Based Exercise Data Display
- **Decision**: Use Neural's flexible string-based data format for display
- **Rationale**: AI-generated content needs flexible formatting
- **Consequences**: Simpler validation but requires careful parsing for special features

### ADR-033: Progressive Enhancement Loading States
- **Decision**: Implement sophisticated loading states that build anticipation
- **Rationale**: Premium AI coaching should feel premium from first interaction
- **Consequences**: Additional complexity but significantly improved perceived value
