# Landing Page Phone Mockup Enhancement

## Overview
Transformed the phone mockup in the HeroSection from generic placeholder content to a realistic representation of the actual `/program` page interface, significantly improving the authenticity and appeal of the landing page.

## Problem Statement
The original phone mockup displayed abstract placeholder content with generic colored bars and shapes that didn't represent the actual application interface. This reduced the credibility and effectiveness of the landing page in demonstrating the real product value.

## Solution
Redesigned the phone mockup to accurately reflect the `/program` page interface with:
- Realistic "Today's Session" workout card
- Actual streak indicator and stats
- Program overview with progress tracking
- Recent workout history
- Proper color scheme matching the app

## Implementation Details

### 1. Phone Mockup Structure
Updated the phone container to display realistic app interface elements:

```tsx
<div className="bg-white"> {/* Changed from gradient overlay */}
  <div className="p-4 h-full flex flex-col">
    {/* Realistic phone header */}
    {/* Today's Session Card */}
    {/* Stats Grid */}
    {/* Program Overview */}
    {/* Workout History */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### 2. Today's Session Card
