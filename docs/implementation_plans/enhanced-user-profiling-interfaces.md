# Enhanced LLM Program Content Implementation Plan

## Overview
Rewrite `src/lib/llmProgramContent.ts` to include comprehensive, cutting-edge exercise science guidelines that will be injected into LLM prompts for scientific context and accurate program generation.

## Scope
Transform the current basic training guidelines into a comprehensive scientific framework covering:

1. **VOLUME_FRAMEWORK_GUIDELINES** - Detailed MEV/MAV/MRV concepts and application
2. **AUTOREGULATION_GUIDELINES** - RPE implementation, load adjustments, fatigue management
3. **PERIODIZATION_GUIDELINES** - DUP, block periodization, adaptation phases
4. **WEAK_POINT_INTERVENTION_GUIDELINES** - Specific protocols for strength imbalances
5. **FATIGUE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDELINES** - Deload timing, recovery markers, adjustments
6. **EXERCISE_SELECTION_GUIDELINES** - Stimulus-to-fatigue ratios and movement patterns

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Structure Organization
- Maintain the existing export format for compatibility
- Each guideline section as a detailed text block
- Include research citations and principles
- Provide specific implementation instructions
- Explain physiological rationale
- Give concrete examples for different scenarios

### 2. Content Framework
Each section will follow this structure:
```
SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES
- Research-backed concepts with citations
- Physiological mechanisms
- Evidence hierarchy

IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOLS
- Step-by-step application methods
- Specific parameters and ranges
- Decision trees for different scenarios

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
- Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced applications
- Common scenarios and solutions
- Troubleshooting guidance

INTEGRATION NOTES
- How this integrates with other systems
- Interaction effects with other variables
- Monitoring and adjustment protocols
```

### 3. Scientific Foundation
- Base content on latest 2024-2025 research
- Include meta-analyses and systematic reviews
- Reference established coaching methodologies (Israetel, Helms, etc.)
- Incorporate autoregulation principles from Reactive Training Systems
- Include periodization models from Bompa, Issurin, and modern research

### 4. Compatibility Considerations
- Maintain integration with existing `autoregulation.ts`
- Align with `volumeCalculations.ts` parameters
- Support `periodization.ts` models
- Compatible with `weakPointAnalysis.ts` protocols
- Work with current `types/program.ts` interfaces

## Expected Outcomes
- LLM prompts will have comprehensive scientific context
- Program recommendations will be evidence-based
- Users will receive education along with prescriptions
- Scientific accuracy and modern best practices
- Seamless integration with existing codebase

## Implementation Confidence: 10/10
This rewrite will significantly enhance the scientific foundation of the application while maintaining full compatibility with existing systems.
