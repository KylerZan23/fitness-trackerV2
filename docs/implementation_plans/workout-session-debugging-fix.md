# Workout Session Flow Debugging Fix

## Issue Description

Users clicking "Start Today's Workout" on the `/program` page were encountering an error:
```
Error: Workout session not found or expired.
```

The error occurred at line 134 in `src/app/workout/new/page.tsx` during session initialization.

## Root Cause Analysis

**FINAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: üéØ

The debugging logs revealed that the issue was **duplicate session retrieval calls**:

1. ‚úÖ **Session Creation**: Works perfectly - session gets created and verified
2. ‚úÖ **First Retrieval**: Session found and data retrieved successfully, then deleted (as designed)
3. ‚ùå **Second Retrieval**: Same session ID called again, but session is gone because it was already deleted

**Cause**: The `useEffect` in `src/app/workout/new/page.tsx` was running multiple times due to:
- React Strict Mode (development mode runs effects twice)
- Component re-rendering
- useEffect dependency changes

The `PGRST116` error occurred because the second call tried to retrieve a session that had already been consumed and deleted.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Creation Debugging (`startWorkoutSession`) ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/app/_actions/workoutSessionActions.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Added comprehensive logging at each step of session creation
- Enhanced authentication error handling with specific error messages
- Added input validation before database insertion
- Added session verification step to confirm creation
- Improved error reporting with specific error codes and details

### 2. Enhanced Session Retrieval Debugging (`getPendingWorkoutSession`) ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/app/_actions/workoutSessionActions.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Added detailed logging for session lookup process
- Added user session summary to show all available sessions
- Added global session check to identify ownership issues
- Enhanced error analysis for `PGRST116` errors
- Added comprehensive debugging output for troubleshooting

### 3. Improved Frontend Error Handling ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/app/workout/new/page.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Added comprehensive logging throughout session initialization
- Enhanced error messages with user-friendly descriptions
- Added specific error handling for different failure scenarios
- Added delay before redirect to allow users to read error messages

### 4. **FINAL FIX: Prevent Duplicate Session Calls** üîß

**File**: `src/app/workout/new/page.tsx`

**Problem**: useEffect was calling `initializeSession` multiple times due to component re-mounting (React Strict Mode), causing the session to be consumed on the first call and fail on subsequent calls.

**Failed Solution #1**: Boolean flag guard
```typescript
const [sessionInitialized, setSessionInitialized] = useState(false)
if (sessionInitialized) return // ‚ùå Failed - component re-mounts reset flag
```

**Working Solution**: Data-based guard that checks existing workout data
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Works - data persists across component re-mounts
if (plannedWorkout || isLoadingWorkoutData) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Session already loaded or loading, skipping duplicate attempt', {
    hasWorkout: !!plannedWorkout,
    isLoading: isLoadingWorkoutData
  })
  return
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- `plannedWorkout` state persists across component re-mounts until page navigation
- `isLoadingWorkoutData` prevents concurrent calls during async operations  
- Natural guard: if data exists, no need to fetch; if loading, wait for completion

**Key Features**:
- Guards against duplicate initialization attempts across component re-mounts
- Maintains proper loading states throughout the session flow
- Eliminates React Strict Mode and re-render issues
- More robust than boolean flags for development environment

## Testing Results

### Before Final Fix:
```
‚úÖ Session created successfully
‚úÖ First retrieval: Session found and deleted  
‚ùå Second retrieval: PGRST116 error - session not found
‚ùå User sees error message in UI
```

### After Final Fix:
```
‚úÖ Session created successfully  
‚úÖ Single retrieval: Session found and deleted
‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate attempt: Skipped due to data-based guard
‚úÖ Workout loads successfully without errors
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/_actions/workoutSessionActions.ts` - Enhanced session creation and retrieval debugging
2. `src/app/workout/new/page.tsx` - Implemented data-based duplicate call prevention
3. `docs/implementation_plans/workout-session-debugging-fix.md` - This documentation
4. `docs/adr/ADR-027-workout-session-duplicate-call-fix.md` - Architectural decision record

## Expected Behavior

1. **Single Session Call**: Session is retrieved only once per workout initialization
2. **Proper Cleanup**: Session is deleted after successful retrieval (by design)
3. **Component Re-mount Resilience**: Works correctly across React Strict Mode re-mounts
4. **Better UX**: Users no longer see error messages during normal operation

## Database Schema Reference

The `pending_workout_sessions` table is working correctly:
```sql
CREATE TABLE pending_workout_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  workout_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  context_data JSONB,
  readiness_data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The session deletion after retrieval is **intentional behavior** to ensure sessions are single-use and don't accumulate in the database.

## Deployment Notes

- ‚úÖ **Issue Resolved**: PGRST116 error completely eliminated
- ‚úÖ **No Database Changes**: Solution is frontend-only
- ‚úÖ **Safe for Production**: No breaking changes or side effects
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for future debugging
- ‚úÖ **Development-Friendly**: Works correctly in React Strict Mode
