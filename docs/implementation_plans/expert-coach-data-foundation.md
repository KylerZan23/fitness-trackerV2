# Expert Coach Data Foundation - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a foundational data structure for expert coaches to establish credibility and expertise in the fitness tracking application.

## Goals
- Define TypeScript interface for expert coach data
- Create realistic mock data with gym-specific credentials
- Provide utility functions for coach data access
- Establish foundation for future coach-related features

## Implementation

### 1. TypeScript Interface Design
```typescript
interface ExpertCoach {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier
  name: string;         // Coach full name
  title: string;        // Professional title
  credentials: string[]; // Certifications and qualifications
  bio_summary: string;  // Brief professional summary
  photo_url: string;    // Profile image URL (placeholder)
  specialties: string[]; // Areas of expertise
}
```

### 2. Mock Coach Data
Create 3 diverse expert coaches representing different fitness specializations:

#### Dr. Alex Stone - Research & Science
- **Credentials**: PhD Kinesiology, CSCS, USAW Level 2
- **Specialties**: Powerlifting, Biomechanics, Program Design, Olympic Lifting
- **Focus**: Scientific approach to training

#### Maria Rodriguez - Practical Strength Training
- **Credentials**: CSCS, RPS Elite Powerlifter, Precision Nutrition L1
- **Specialties**: Powerlifting, Strength Training, Competition Prep, Injury Prevention
- **Focus**: Real-world strength development

#### James Chen - Elite Performance
- **Credentials**: Olympic Competitor 2016, USAW Level 4, NASM-CPT
- **Specialties**: Olympic Weightlifting, Explosive Power, Athletic Performance
- **Focus**: Peak performance and competition

### 3. Utility Functions
- `getCoachById(id)` - Retrieve specific coach
- `getCoachesBySpecialty(specialty)` - Filter by expertise area
- `getAllSpecialties()` - Get unique list of all specialties

## Technical Considerations
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with strict typing
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new coaches or modify existing data
- **Performance**: In-memory data access with O(1) and O(n) operations
- **Reusability**: Utility functions for common access patterns

## Future Enhancements
- Database integration for dynamic coach management
- Coach-to-program matching based on user goals
- Real coach profile photos and extended biographies
- Coach rating and review system
- Specialization-based program attribution

## Integration Points
- AI program generation (coach expertise attribution)
- Landing page testimonials and credibility
- About page team showcase
- Program details with coach recommendations

## Files Created
- `src/lib/coaches.ts` - Complete coach data system

## Success Criteria
- ✅ TypeScript interface properly defined
- ✅ 3 realistic mock coaches with diverse specializations
- ✅ Utility functions for data access
- ✅ Placeholder image URLs established
- ✅ Foundation ready for future feature development
