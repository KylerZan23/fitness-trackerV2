# AI Coach Feature Consolidation Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Feature:** Consolidate AI Coach functionality into dedicated feature with subscription controls

## Overview

Refactor the scattered AI Coach functionality into a cohesive, dedicated feature section with proper subscription/feature flag controls. This consolidates weekly reviews, goal setting, weak-point analysis, and coaching recommendations under a unified AI Coach experience.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components
1. **AIWeeklyReviewCard** (`src/components/progress/AIWeeklyReviewCard.tsx`)
   - Currently used in Progress page
   - Provides weekly performance analysis with follow-up questions
   - Fully functional with server actions

2. **AICoachCard** (`src/components/dashboard/AICoachCard.tsx`)
   - Daily workout recommendations
   - Not currently integrated in main navigation
   - Has feedback system built-in

3. **AI Coach Actions** (`src/app/_actions/aiCoachActions.ts`)
   - `getAIWeeklyReview()` - Weekly performance analysis
   - `getAIWeeklyReviewFollowUp()` - Interactive Q&A
   - `getAICoachRecommendation()` - Daily recommendations

4. **Weak Point Analysis** (Multiple files)
   - `src/lib/weakPointAnalysis.ts` - Core analysis logic
   - Strength ratio analysis and corrective protocols
   - Currently only used in program generation

### Current Issues
- Features scattered across different pages
- No dedicated AI Coach navigation section  
- No subscription/access control implementation
- Weak point analysis buried in program generation
- No unified user experience for AI coaching

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Navigation Integration
**File:** `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
- Add "AI Coach" navigation item with Brain icon
- Position between "Progress" and "Profile" 
- Route: `/ai-coach`

### 2. Dedicated AI Coach Page
**File:** `src/app/ai-coach/page.tsx`
- Unified dashboard for all AI Coach functionality
- Subscription access control wrapper
- Clean, professional layout with feature sections

### 3. Feature Consolidation Structure
```typescript
// AI Coach Dashboard Sections:
1. Weekly Review & Analysis (existing AIWeeklyReviewCard)
2. Daily Recommendations (existing AICoachCard) 
3. Weak Point Analysis (new component)
4. Goal Setting & Tracking (consolidated)
5. Coaching Insights & Trends (new)
```

### 4. Subscription Access Control
**Implementation:**
- Use existing subscription utility functions
- Feature flag control for AI Coach access
- Graceful degradation for trial/free users
- Clear upgrade prompts for premium features

### 5. Component Refactoring
- Move AI Coach components to `src/components/ai-coach/`
- Create unified layout wrapper
- Maintain existing functionality while improving organization
- Add loading states and error boundaries

## Technical Implementation

2. Add AI Coach route to sidebar navigation
3. Create basic AI Coach page with subscription control
4. Implement feature access checking

### Phase 2: Component Integration  
1. Create AI Coach layout wrapper component
2. Refactor AIWeeklyReviewCard for new context
3. Integrate AICoachCard into dashboard
4. Create weak point analysis component

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Add goal setting integration
2. Create coaching insights section
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Add loading states and optimizations

### Phase 4: Access Control & Testing
1. Implement subscription-based access control
2. Add feature flags for granular control
3. Update existing integrations
4. Comprehensive testing and documentation

## File Structure Changes

### New Files
```
src/app/ai-coach/
├── page.tsx                     # Main AI Coach dashboard
├── loading.tsx                  # Loading state
└── error.tsx                    # Error boundary

src/components/ai-coach/
├── AICoachDashboard.tsx         # Main dashboard wrapper
├── WeakPointAnalysisCard.tsx    # Weak point analysis component
├── GoalSettingCard.tsx          # Goal setting integration
├── CoachingInsightsCard.tsx     # Trend analysis and insights
└── SubscriptionGate.tsx         # Access control wrapper
```

### Modified Files
```
src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx           # Add AI Coach navigation
src/components/progress/AIWeeklyReviewCard.tsx  # Refactor for new context
src/components/dashboard/AICoachCard.tsx    # Integrate into dashboard
src/app/progress/page.tsx                   # Remove AI Coach components
```

## Subscription Control Strategy

### Access Levels
- **Free Trial:** Limited AI Coach access (1 weekly review per week)
- **Premium:** Full AI Coach access with all features
- **Feature Flags:** Granular control for beta features

### Implementation
```typescript
// Use existing subscription utilities
import { getSubscriptionStatus, hasActiveAccess } from '@/lib/subscription'

// Subscription checking in AI Coach page
const subscriptionStatus = await getSubscriptionStatus(userId)
const hasAccess = subscriptionStatus.hasAccess

// Feature-specific access control
if (!hasAccess) {
  return <UpgradePrompt feature="AI Coach" />
}
```

## User Experience Design

### Dashboard Layout
1. **Header Section:** AI Coach branding with status indicator
2. **Primary Cards:** Weekly Review, Daily Recommendations
3. **Analysis Section:** Weak Point Analysis, Goal Progress
4. **Insights Section:** Trends, Coaching Tips, Follow-up Questions

### Visual Design
- Consistent with existing app design system
- Brain icon theme throughout AI Coach section
- Color-coded sections for different types of insights
- Clear call-to-action buttons and navigation

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for API failures
- Clear error messages with retry options
- Subscription status handling
- Loading states for all async operations

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Non-Breaking Addition
