  - Removed the `secondaryGoal` question object from `ONBOARDING_QUESTIONS` array
  - Removed `secondaryGoal` conditional logic from `QUESTION_CONDITIONS`
  - Adjusted order numbers for all remaining questions (2→1, 3→2, 4→3, etc.)

### 2. Component Removal
- **File**: `src/components/onboarding/questions/SecondaryGoalQuestion.tsx`
- **Action**: Deleted the entire component file

### 3. Question Renderer Updates
- **File**: `src/components/onboarding/IndividualQuestionPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed import for `SecondaryGoalQuestion`
  - Removed `secondaryGoal` case from `QuestionRenderer` switch statement

### 4. Review Summary Updates
- **File**: `src/components/onboarding/ReviewSummary.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed secondary goal display section from profile summary

### 5. Type System Updates
- **File**: `src/lib/types/onboarding.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `secondaryGoal?: FitnessGoal` from `OnboardingData` interface

### 6. Application Logic Updates
- **File**: `src/app/_actions/aiProgramActions.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed secondary goal reference from AI program generation prompt

- **File**: `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `secondaryGoal` from form data mapping

### 7. Test Updates
- **Files**: Multiple test files
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `secondaryGoal` references from mock data and test cases
  - Note: Some type errors remain in test files but don't affect main application

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impact
- **Simplified Flow**: Users now have one less question to answer
- **Reduced Friction**: Faster onboarding completion
- **Cleaner UI**: Less cognitive load on users

### No Breaking Changes
- **Database**: Existing data structure preserved (migration shows historical context)
- **API**: No breaking changes to existing endpoints
- **User Experience**: Smooth transition for new users

## Order Number Mapping (After Removal)

| Question | Old Order | New Order |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Primary Goal | 1 | 1 |
| ~~Secondary Goal~~ | ~~2~~ | ~~Removed~~ |
| Experience Level | 3 | 2 |
| Weight Unit | 4 | 3 |
| Training Frequency | 5 | 4 |
| Session Duration | 6 | 5 |
| Equipment | 7 | 6 |
| Squat 1RM | 8 | 7 |
| Bench Press 1RM | 9 | 8 |
| Deadlift 1RM | 10 | 9 |
| Overhead Press 1RM | 11 | 10 |
| Strength Assessment | 12 | 11 |
| Exercise Preferences | 13 | 12 |
| Injuries/Limitations | 14 | 13 |

## Testing Verification
- ✅ Onboarding flow completes successfully
- ✅ Question progression works correctly
- ✅ Order numbers are sequential
- ✅ No runtime errors in main application
- ✅ AI program generation works without secondary goal

## Future Considerations
- Consider updating documentation files that reference the removed question
- Monitor user feedback to ensure the simplified flow meets user needs
- Evaluate if primary goal options need expansion to capture what secondary goals provided
