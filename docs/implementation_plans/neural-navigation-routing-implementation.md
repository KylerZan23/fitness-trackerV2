## Route Structure

The following new routes have been implemented:

```
/neural/onboarding          - Neural program creation flow
/programs                   - Neural programs dashboard  
/programs/[id]              - Individual Neural program view
/programs/[id]/week/[week]  - Weekly Neural program view
```

## User Flow

The updated user flow creates a seamless experience:

1. **General Onboarding** → Saves user preferences
2. **Neural Onboarding** → Creates personalized AI program
3. **Programs Dashboard** → Manages Neural programs
4. **Program View** → Detailed program overview
5. **Week View** → Weekly workout execution

## Technical Integration

### API Endpoints
- All routes properly integrate with existing API endpoints
- Authentication handled consistently across routes
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states and progress indicators

### Component Reuse
- Leverages existing `NeuralOnboardingFlow` component
- Uses `NeuralProgramDisplay` for consistency
- Maintains existing UI component patterns
- Consistent styling with Neural branding

### Mobile Responsiveness
- All routes designed mobile-first
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized for various screen sizes

## Assumptions and Decisions

### Design Decisions
1. **Neural Prominence** - Positioned Neural Programs as primary navigation item
2. **Visual Branding** - Consistent blue-to-purple gradient theme
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Information hierarchy from program → week → workout
4. **Completion Tracking** - Visual progress indicators throughout

### Technical Decisions
1. **Route Protection** - All routes include authentication checks
2. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error states and user guidance
3. **Performance** - Efficient API calls and state management
4. **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Benefits Achieved
