# Activities Feed Implementation Plan

## Overview
Successfully transformed the community "PR Feed" tab into an "Activities" tab that displays workout activities from followed users in a Strava-like card format.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Community Page Updates
- **File**: `src/app/community/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated tab name from "PR Feed" to "Activities"
- **Change**: Replaced `CommunityFeed` component with new `ActivitiesFeed` component

### 2. Server Actions
- **File**: `src/app/_actions/communityActions.ts`
- **Added**: `getFollowedUsersActivities()` function
- **Added**: `FollowedUserActivity` interface
- **Features**:
  - Fetches workout groups and individual workouts from followed users
  - Calculates workout statistics (volume, sets, duration)
  - Groups individual workouts by user and date for better organization
  - Returns properly formatted activity data

### 3. Activity Card Component
- **File**: `src/components/community/WorkoutActivityCard.tsx` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - Strava-like card design matching the provided image
  - User avatar and name display
  - Workout type icon with color coding (Push/Pull/Legs)
  - Three-column stats grid (Duration, Sets, Volume)
  - PR badge support (when available)
  - Exercise count display
  - Responsive design with hover effects

### 4. Activities Feed Component  
- **File**: `src/components/community/ActivitiesFeed.tsx` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - Fetches and displays followed users' activities
  - Loading skeleton animations
  - Empty state with helpful messaging
  - Error handling with retry functionality
  - Activity count display

### 5. Component Exports
- **File**: `src/components/community/index.ts`
- **Added**: Exports for `ActivitiesFeed` and `WorkoutActivityCard`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. `ActivitiesFeed` component loads and calls `getFollowedUsersActivities()`
2. Server action fetches:
   - List of users the current user follows
   - Workout groups from those users
   - Individual workouts from those users
   - User profiles for display
3. Data is processed to calculate stats and group activities
4. Activities are sorted by date and returned
5. `WorkoutActivityCard` components render each activity

### Workout Statistics Calculation
- **Volume**: Total weight lifted (weight × sets × reps) across all exercises
- **Sets**: Total number of sets performed
- **Duration**: Total workout time in minutes
- **Exercises**: Count of different exercises performed

### Activity Grouping Logic
- Workout groups are displayed as single activities
- Individual workouts are grouped by user and date to create "sessions"
- Mixed training sessions show exercise count instead of single exercise name

### Icon Logic
- Push/Chest/Bench exercises: Blue dumbbell icon
- Pull/Back/Row exercises: Green target icon  
- Leg/Squat/Deadlift exercises: Purple trending up icon
- Default/Mixed: Orange dumbbell icon

## User Experience Improvements

### Empty State
- Clear messaging when no activities are available
- Guidance to follow users to populate the feed
- Helpful direction to Communities tab

### Loading State
- Skeleton animations matching the card layout
- Three placeholder cards for better visual feedback

### Error Handling
- Graceful error display with retry button
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Fallback to empty state when needed

## Database Dependencies
- Requires existing `user_followers` table for follow relationships
- Uses `workout_groups` and `workouts` tables for activity data
- Leverages `profiles` table for user information

## Future Enhancements
- PR detection and badge display
- Exercise-specific details expansion
- Activity filtering by workout type
- Real-time activity updates
- Activity reactions/comments

## Testing Considerations
- Test with users who follow others vs. those who don't
- Verify workout group vs. individual workout display
- Test loading and error states
- Validate statistics calculations
- Check responsive design on mobile devices

## Performance Notes
- Limits query results to prevent excessive data loading
- Uses efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Implements proper loading states to improve perceived performance
- Groups database calls to minimize request count
