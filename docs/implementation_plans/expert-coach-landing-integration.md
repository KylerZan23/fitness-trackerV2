# Expert Coach Landing Page Integration - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Integrate the expert coach data system into the main landing page to establish credibility and showcase the expertise behind the AI-powered fitness programs.

## Goals
- Add credible expert presence to landing page
- Establish trust through professional credentials
- Position AI as backed by real fitness experts
- Create visual appeal with coach profiles
- Emphasize scientific accuracy and expertise

## Implementation

### 1. Section Placement
- **Location**: Added immediately after HowItWorks section, before Testimonials
- **Rationale**: Users learn how the app works, then see the experts behind it, then hear testimonials
- **Flow**: HeroSection → SocialProof → Features → HowItWorks → **ExpertCoaches** → Testimonials

### 2. Content Structure
```
Meet the Experts Behind Your AI Coach
↓
"Our AI is trained and overseen by these world-class experts..."
↓
[Coach Grid - 3 cards in responsive layout]
↓
"Combined, our experts have trained hundreds of elite athletes..."
```

### 3. Visual Design Elements

#### Coach Cards
- **Card Layout**: Clean white cards with subtle shadow and hover effects
- **Profile Images**: 96px circular avatars with gradient fallback
- **Fallback System**: Initials displayed if profile image fails to load
- **Responsive Grid**: 1 column mobile → 2 columns tablet → 3 columns desktop

#### Credential Display
- **Primary Credentials**: Highlighted as secondary badges (CSCS, PhD, etc.)
- **Specialties**: Outlined badges for areas of expertise
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Name → Title → Credentials → Bio → Specialties

#### Brand Integration
- **Color Scheme**: Uses brand-primary coral/orange for titles and gradients
- **Background**: Light gray section background for contrast
- **Typography**: Consistent with existing landing page font hierarchy

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Data Integration
```typescript
import { EXPERT_COACHES } from '@/lib/coaches'
import { Card, CardContent } from '@/components/ui/card'
import { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge'
```

#### Component Structure
```typescript
const ExpertCoachesSection = () => (
  <section className="py-16 bg-gray-50">
    {/* Header */}
    {/* Coach Grid */}
    {/* Footer Message */}
  </section>
)
```

#### Error Handling
- Image loading fallback to initials
- Graceful degradation if coach data unavailable
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
