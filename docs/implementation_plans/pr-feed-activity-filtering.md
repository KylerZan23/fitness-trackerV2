# PR Feed Activity Filtering Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Community page "Activity Feed" tab to exclusively display Personal Record (PR) achievements for the big three powerlifting movements: bench press, squat, and deadlift. This creates a focused celebration space for major strength milestones.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Query Filtering
- **File**: `src/components/community/CommunityFeed.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `.eq('event_type', 'NEW_PB')` filter to only fetch PR events from `community_feed_events` table
  - Reduced unnecessary data transfer by filtering at the database level

### 2. Exercise-Specific Filtering
- **File**: `src/components/community/CommunityFeed.tsx`
- **Logic**: Added client-side filtering for big three exercises
  ```typescript
  const bigThreeExercises = ['bench press', 'squat', 'deadlift']
  
  .filter((event: any) => {
    if (event.event_type === 'NEW_PB' && event.metadata?.exerciseName) {
      const exerciseName = event.metadata.exerciseName.toLowerCase()
      return bigThreeExercises.some(exercise => 
        exerciseName.includes(exercise) || 
        exerciseName.includes(exercise.replace(' ', ''))
      )
    }
    return false
  })
  ```

### 3. UI/UX Updates
- **Tab Label**: Changed from "Activity Feed" to "PR Feed" with Trophy icon
- **Empty State**: Updated messaging to reflect PR-focused purpose
  - Icon: Changed from Users to Trophy
  - Header: "No PRs to celebrate yet"
  - Description: "Hit a new personal record in bench press, squat, or deadlift to see it celebrated here! üèÜ"

### 4. Import Cleanup
- **File**: `src/app/community/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed unused `Flame` import

## Technical Implementation Details

### PR Event Structure
```typescript
interface CommunityFeedEvent {
  id: string
  event_type: 'NEW_PB'  // Only NEW_PB events are shown
  metadata: {
    exerciseName: string    // Must be bench press, squat, or deadlift
    weight: number
    reps: number
    pbType: 'heaviest-weight' | 'most-reps' | 'weight-at-reps' | 'first-time'
    previousBest?: { weight: number; reps: number }
  }
  created_at: string
  user: UserInfo
}
```

### Exercise Name Matching
The filtering logic accommodates various exercise name formats:
- **Bench Press**: "bench press", "bench", "barbell bench press"
- **Squat**: "squat", "back squat", "front squat", "barbell squat"
- **Deadlift**: "deadlift", "conventional deadlift", "sumo deadlift"

The matching is case-insensitive and handles both spaced and non-spaced variations.

## Data Flow

1. **PR Detection**: When users log workouts, `checkAndRegisterPB()` function determines if a new PR was achieved
2. **Event Creation**: PR achievements automatically create `NEW_PB` events in `community_feed_events` table
3. **Feed Display**: CommunityFeed component fetches and filters events to show only big three PRs
4. **Real-time Updates**: New PRs appear immediately in the community feed

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Changes
- **Focused Celebration**: Users see only the most significant strength achievements
- **Reduced Noise**: Eliminates routine workout completions and other activities
- **Clear Purpose**: Tab name and content clearly communicate the PR focus
- **Performance**: Database filtering reduces data transfer and client-side processing

### Maintained Functionality
- **PR Tracking**: All existing PR detection and recording logic unchanged
- **User Experience**: Same feed interface, just with filtered content
- **Data Integrity**: No changes to underlying data structure or storage

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Exercise Expansion**: Could add overhead press as a fourth major lift
2. **Filter Options**: Allow users to toggle between all PRs vs. big three only
3. **PR Categories**: Separate tabs for different PR types (weight, reps, volume)
4. **Achievement Badges**: Special recognition for milestone PRs (bodyweight, 2x bodyweight, etc.)

### Performance Optimization
- Consider adding database indexes on `event_type` and `metadata` fields if feed grows large
- Implement pagination for high-activity communities

## Testing Verification
- ‚úÖ Only NEW_PB events are fetched from database
- ‚úÖ Only bench press, squat, and deadlift PRs are displayed
- ‚úÖ Tab label correctly shows "PR Feed" with Trophy icon
- ‚úÖ Empty state messaging is appropriate for PR focus
- ‚úÖ No impact on PR detection or creation logic
- ‚úÖ Clean compilation with no TypeScript errors

## User Experience
Users will now see a curated feed of the most meaningful strength achievements, creating a more motivating and focused community experience. The clear PR focus helps establish the community as a place to celebrate significant fitness milestones rather than routine activity logging.
