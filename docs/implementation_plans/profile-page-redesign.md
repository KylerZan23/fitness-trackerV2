# Profile Page Redesign Implementation

## Overview
Successfully updated the public profile page (`/p/[userId]`) to display personal user information instead of workout statistics, creating a more engaging and informative user profile experience.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Data Structure Updates
- **Expanded UserProfile Interface**: Added new fields for personal information
  - `primary_training_focus`
  - `experience_level` 
  - `age` and `birth_date`
  - `professional_title`
  - `followers_count` and `following_count`

### 2. Database Query Enhancement
- **Updated Profile Query**: Now fetches comprehensive user data
- **Age Calculation**: Smart age calculation from birth_date with fallback to age field
- **Removed Workout Stats**: Eliminated unused workout statistics calculations

### 3. UI Component Redesign

#### Before (Workout Statistics):
- Total Workouts
- Total Sets  
- Total Weight (kg)
- Total Hours

#### After (Personal Information):
- **Training Focus**: Primary fitness focus (e.g., "Strength Training", "Hypertrophy")
- **Age**: Calculated from birth_date or direct age field
- **Experience Level**: User's training experience (e.g., "Beginner", "Advanced")
- **Personal Records**: Count of unique exercise PRs
- **Followers**: Number of users following this profile
- **Following**: Number of users this profile follows

### 4. Icon and Color Updates
- **Training Focus**: Flame icon (blue gradient)
- **Age**: User icon (green gradient)  
- **Experience**: Star icon (purple gradient)
- **Personal Records**: Trophy icon (orange gradient)
- **Followers**: Users icon (indigo gradient)
- **Following**: Users icon (pink gradient)

### 5. Header Enhancement
- **Dynamic Professional Title**: Shows user's professional title or defaults to "Fitness Athlete"

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Fetching
```typescript
// Enhanced profile query
const { data: profile, error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select(`
    id, name, email, profile_picture_url,
    primary_training_focus, experience_level,
    age, birth_date, professional_title,
    followers_count, following_count
  `)
  .eq('id', userId)
  .single()
```

### Age Calculation Logic
```typescript
const age = profile.birth_date 
  ? Math.floor((new Date().getTime() - new Date(profile.birth_date).getTime()) / (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000))
  : profile.age
```

### Fallback Values
- Training Focus: Defaults to "General Fitness"
- Experience Level: Defaults to "Beginner"
- Age: Shows "â€”" if not available
- Followers/Following: Defaults to 0
- Professional Title: Defaults to "Fitness Athlete"

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Two-row Grid Layout**: Personal info in top row, social stats in bottom row
- **Consistent Card Design**: Maintained gradient backgrounds and hover effects
- **Icon Consistency**: Meaningful icons for each data type
- **Color Coding**: Different color gradients for easy visual distinction

### Information Architecture
- **Personal Details First**: Most relevant user information prominently displayed
- **Social Proof**: Followers/following counts for community engagement
- **Achievement Focus**: PR count highlights user accomplishments
- **Experience Context**: Training level provides context for achievements

### Responsive Design
- **Grid Layout**: Maintains responsiveness across devices
- **Icon Sizing**: Consistent 6x6 icon sizing for visual balance
- **Typography**: Appropriate font weights and sizes for hierarchy
