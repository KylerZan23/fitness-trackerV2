# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to transform NeuralLift from a project to a scalable, reliable product.

## Objectives

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated testing, linting, and building on every PR
2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automated deployment to staging and production environments
3. **Quality Gates**: Ensure code quality and prevent broken deployments
4. **Supabase Integration**: Handle database migrations in CI/CD workflow

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: CI Workflow (Pull Request Validation)

**Triggers**: Pull requests to `main` branch
**Goals**: Validate code quality before merge

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Environment Setup**

   - Node.js 18.x (LTS)
   - Yarn caching for dependencies
   - Environment variables for testing

2. **Quality Checks**

   - Install dependencies (`yarn install --frozen-lockfile`)
   - Run linting (`yarn lint`)
   - Run formatting check (`yarn format:check`)
   - Run unit tests with coverage (`yarn test:coverage`)
   - Build application (`yarn build`)

3. **E2E Testing**

   - Install Playwright browsers
   - Start development server
   - Run E2E tests (`yarn test:e2e`)
   - Upload test artifacts on failure

4. **Security & Dependencies**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Code quality analysis

### Phase 2: CD Workflow (Deployment Pipeline)

**Triggers**: Push to `main` branch (after PR merge)
**Goals**: Deploy to staging, then production after verification

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Staging Deployment**

   - Run all CI checks
   - Deploy to staging environment (Vercel Preview)
   - Run database migrations against staging DB
   - Run smoke tests against staging

2. **Production Deployment** (Manual Trigger)
   - Deploy to production environment
   - Run database migrations against production DB
   - Health checks and monitoring alerts

### Phase 3: Environment Configuration

**Staging Environment:**

- Separate Supabase project or staging database
- Environment-specific secrets
- Preview deployments for testing

**Production Environment:**

- Production Supabase project
- Production secrets and configurations
- Monitoring and alerting

## Technical Implementation

### Required GitHub Secrets

```
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_STAGING
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_STAGING
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_STAGING
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN_STAGING

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_PROD
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_PROD
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_PROD
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN_PROD

# Deployment
VERCEL_TOKEN
VERCEL_ORG_ID
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
```

### Workflow Files Structure

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── ci.yml           # Pull request validation
    ├── cd-staging.yml   # Staging deployment
    └── cd-production.yml # Production deployment
```

### Database Migration Strategy

1. **Migration Validation**: Dry-run migrations in CI
2. **Staging Migrations**: Automatic on staging deployment
3. **Production Migrations**: Manual approval required
4. **Rollback Plan**: Database backup before migrations

## Quality Gates

### CI Requirements (Must Pass for PR Merge)

- ✅ All linting rules pass
- ✅ Code formatting is correct
- ✅ Unit test coverage > 80%
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ E2E tests pass
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities

### CD Requirements (Must Pass for Deployment)

- ✅ All CI checks pass
- ✅ Database migrations validate successfully
- ✅ Staging deployment succeeds
- ✅ Smoke tests pass on staging
- ✅ Manual approval for production (initially)

## Monitoring & Observability

1. **Build Notifications**: Slack/email alerts for failures
2. **Deployment Status**: Real-time deployment monitoring
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Core Web Vitals tracking
4. **Error Tracking**: Runtime error monitoring

## Rollback Strategy

1. **Code Rollback**: Git revert + redeploy previous version
2. **Database Rollback**: Automated backup restoration
3. **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout capability (future enhancement)

## Success Metrics

- **CI Pipeline**: < 5 minutes execution time
- **CD Pipeline**: < 10 minutes for complete deployment
- **Test Coverage**: > 80% maintained
- **Deployment Success Rate**: > 99%
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: < 30 minutes

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Database Migrations**: Backup before migration, validation in staging
2. **Environment Parity**: Staging mirrors production configuration
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Manual production approval initially
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for deployment issues

## Implementation Timeline

- **Day 1**: CI workflow setup and testing
- **Day 2**: CD staging workflow and environment setup
- **Day 3**: Production deployment workflow
- **Day 4**: Testing, documentation, and team training

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Dependency Updates**: Dependabot integration
2. **Security Scanning**: CodeQL analysis
3. **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse CI integration
4. **Feature Flags**: Gradual feature rollout capability
5. **Multi-environment Support**: Development, staging, production tiers
