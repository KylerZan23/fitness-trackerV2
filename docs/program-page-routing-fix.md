# Program Page Routing Fix

## Issue Description

After completing onboarding and generating an AI training program, users were being redirected to the `/dashboard` page instead of the more relevant `/program` page where they can immediately view their newly generated training program.

## Solution Implemented

Updated all routing logic to redirect users to `/program` instead of `/dashboard` after successful AI training program generation.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` (New Individual Question Flow)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Check if there was a warning (program generation failed but onboarding succeeded)
if ('warning' in result && result.warning) {
  console.warn('Program generation warning:', result.warning)
  // You could show a toast notification here
  // For now, we'll still redirect to dashboard with a query param
  router.push('/dashboard?onboarding=completed&program_warning=true')
} else {
  // Complete success - redirect to dashboard
  router.push('/dashboard?onboarding=completed&program=generated')
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Check if there was a warning (program generation failed but onboarding succeeded)
if ('warning' in result && result.warning) {
  console.warn('Program generation warning:', result.warning)
  // You could show a toast notification here
  // For now, we'll still redirect to program page with a query param
  router.push('/program?onboarding=completed&program_warning=true')
} else {
  // Complete success - redirect to program page
  router.push('/program?onboarding=completed&program=generated')
}
```

### 2. `src/app/onboarding/page-old.tsx` (Legacy Multi-Step Flow)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Redirect to dashboard or a success page
router.push('/dashboard?onboarding=completed')
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Redirect to program page to view the generated training program
router.push('/program?onboarding=completed')
```

**Also updated existing program check:**
```typescript
// Before
console.log('User has completed onboarding and has active program, redirecting to dashboard')
router.replace('/dashboard')

// After
console.log('User has completed onboarding and has active program, redirecting to program page')
router.replace('/program')
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved User Experience**
- Users immediately see their newly generated training program
- No additional navigation required to view the program
- Direct access to program details, phases, and workouts

### 2. **Better Context**
- Users land on the most relevant page for their completed action
- Program page provides comprehensive view of their personalized training plan
- Immediate access to start their first workout

### 3. **Logical Flow**
- Onboarding → Program Generation → Program View
- Natural progression from setup to execution
- Reduces cognitive load and confusion

### 4. **Query Parameters Preserved**
- `?onboarding=completed` - Indicates successful onboarding completion
- `?program=generated` - Indicates successful program generation
- `?program_warning=true` - Indicates program generation had issues

## Validation

- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ Both onboarding flows (new and legacy) updated
- ✅ Query parameters preserved for tracking and analytics
- ✅ Existing program check logic updated
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Users immediately see their generated training program
- **Engagement**: Higher likelihood of users starting their first workout
- **Clarity**: Clear indication that program generation was successful
- **Navigation**: Reduced steps to access the primary feature (training program)
