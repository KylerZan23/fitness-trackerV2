# AI Program Generation - Deeper Personalization Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of Task Group I.A.1, I.B.1, and I.B.2 for enhancing AI Training Program generation with deeper personalization capabilities.

## Objectives Completed
1. **Explicit Injury/Preference Handling** (I.A.1)
2. **Detailed Exercise Notes/Form Cues** (I.B.1) 
3. **Program Rationale** (I.B.2)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Mandatory Injury/Limitation & Preference Handling
**Location**: `src/app/_actions/aiProgramActions.ts` - `constructLLMPrompt` function

**Enhancement**: Added new section in LLM prompt instructions that:
- Explicitly references user's `injuriesLimitations` and `exercisePreferences` from onboarding data
- Provides specific injury-aware exercise substitutions (e.g., knee pain → Leg Press vs Deep Squats)
- Enforces exercise preference compliance (avoid dislikes, prioritize likes)
- Includes concrete examples for common injuries (shoulder impingement, lower back sensitivity)

**Safety Impact**: Critical safety enhancement that prevents AI from recommending potentially harmful exercises for users with specific injuries or limitations.

### 2. Detailed Exercise Notes/Form Cues
**Location**: `src/app/_actions/aiProgramActions.ts` - Structure & Content section

**Enhancement**: Enhanced `ExerciseDetail.notes` field population with:
- Mandatory form cues for major compound lifts (Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press)
- Experience-level appropriate guidance (more detailed for beginners)
- Injury modification notifications when exercises are adapted
- Specific examples provided to LLM for consistency

**User Experience Impact**: Significantly improves workout quality and safety by providing actionable form guidance directly in the program.

### 3. Program Rationale in generalAdvice
**Location**: `src/app/_actions/aiProgramActions.ts` - Output Format section

**Enhancement**: Enhanced `TrainingProgram.generalAdvice` field with:
- 2-3 sentence explanation of program structure
- Alignment justification with user's Primary Goal, Experience Level, and Available Equipment
- Concrete example provided to ensure consistent output format

**Personalization Impact**: Helps users understand why their specific program was designed the way it was, increasing buy-in and adherence.

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes
- **File Modified**: `src/app/_actions/aiProgramActions.ts`
- **Function Enhanced**: `constructLLMPrompt(profile: UserProfileForGeneration)`
- **Lines Modified**: ~310-350 (instruction section)

### Integration Points
- Leverages existing `OnboardingData` interface fields:
  - `injuriesLimitations?: string`
  - `exercisePreferences?: string`
- Utilizes existing `ExerciseDetail.notes?: string` field
- Populates existing `TrainingProgram.generalAdvice?: string` field

### Data Flow
1. User onboarding data collected → stored in `profiles.onboarding_responses`
2. Program generation triggered → `constructLLMPrompt` accesses injury/preference data
3. Enhanced prompt sent to LLM → AI generates personalized program with safety considerations
4. Validated program saved → includes detailed notes and rationale

## Safety Considerations
- **Injury Handling**: Explicit avoidance of contraindicated exercises
- **Progressive Approach**: Conservative recommendations for beginners
- **Clear Communication**: Users understand modifications made for their safety

## Quality Assurance
- **Prompt Validation**: Instructions are clearly demarcated and logically integrated
- **Field Population**: All three target fields (injury handling, notes, generalAdvice) are addressed
- **Backward Compatibility**: Changes are additive and don't break existing functionality

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Improved Safety**: Reduced risk of injury-aggravating exercise recommendations
2. **Enhanced Personalization**: Programs that truly reflect user preferences and limitations
3. **Better User Experience**: Clear form guidance and program rationale increase confidence
4. **Increased Adherence**: Users more likely to follow programs they understand and trust

## Future Enhancements
- Monitor user feedback on injury accommodations
- Expand form cue database based on common user questions
- Add injury-specific progression protocols
- Implement feedback loop for program rationale effectiveness

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various injury scenarios (knee, shoulder, back issues)
2. Verify form cues appear for compound movements
3. Confirm generalAdvice provides meaningful rationale
4. Validate with different experience levels and equipment combinations
