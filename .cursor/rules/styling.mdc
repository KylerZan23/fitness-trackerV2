# Styling Convention

This project primarily uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Utility classes are applied directly within the JSX of React components.

Refer to the [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts) file for any custom theme configurations, plugins, or base layer modifications.

The global CSS file, likely [src/app/globals.css](mdc:src/app/globals.css), contains base Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`) and potentially some minimal global styles or custom base styles.
